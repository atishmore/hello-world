# hello-world
Hello-world repository to learn about git-hub

I wish I could restrict myself to one thing. But I want to be master of all. I believe to start with I need to master is to focus on a few things and the list is as below
  1) Machine Learning
  2) HTML, CSS, javascript
  3) Java and Selenium
  4) PRINCE2


Here are the things I wish to do by learning the above
  1) Machine learning - Identify chances of social isolation for an individual
                      - Identify chances of planting trees in a given locality given pictures of activity from satellites
  2) HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT - I wish to create a website for Indian Colours and may be earn some money by creating similar websites especially if I lose my job
  3) Java and Selenium - Despite an expert in manual testing, test management and e2e testing, manual testing and object oriented programming are the areas that I lack. I would like to establish myself in this area
  4) PRINCE2 - I am trying to get a new job. I am a very skilled Project Management Professional. But I believe in this market Prince2 certification will give me that extra edge.
